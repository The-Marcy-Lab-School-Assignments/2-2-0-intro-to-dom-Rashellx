# Question
When would you want to use `.innerHTML` to create some new html, and when would you want to use `.createElement` and node updates?

# Answer
I would want to use `.innerHTML` to create some new html when I need to replace or update a large portion/block of html. On the other hand, I would use `.createElemnt` when I need to control individual elements. It is better for security purposes.
